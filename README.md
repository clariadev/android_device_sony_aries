=========================

My first porting on Xperia device. Inspired from sirius device porting by cyanogenmod.

Some useless proprietary files from sirius are surely present, need to clean up and add more necessary files.

Works : Boot on Trebuchet.

Seems to work: bluetooth, torch.

Doesn't work: sound, wifi, camera, etc. 

Not tested : network.

After some time in screen off, screen doesn't seem to answer to touch action and need a reboot.

Work in progress.
